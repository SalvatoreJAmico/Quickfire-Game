Milestone: Milestone 9 - Final Design Document

Abstract

The "Quickfire Game" is a 2-4 player game built around an Arduino board, ideal for group enjoyment and skill enhancement. It challenges players to swiftly react to a light and sound cue, with their reaction times sparking friendly rivalry. It features multiplayer and single-player modes and is perfect for gatherings and solo play. The construction includes assembling LEDs, buttons, resistors, and an LCD into a case, offering a hands-on experience in electronics. The "Quickfire Game" is an excellent choice for family and friends, combining entertainment with educational value.

Overall Description of Project Idea

The "Quickfire Game" is a fun and interactive project designed for 2 to 4 players. This project is ideal for bringing people together, offering an entertaining and engaging way to enjoy each other's company while indulging in a bit of friendly competition. The game begins with a random delay signaled by pulsing white lights, after which players must react to white light and a piezo sound to press their button as quickly as possible. The project involves assembling a circuit with elements like LEDs, buttons, resistors, and an LCD for display, all of which are assembled in a custom case. The case design, which is crafted from materials like plexiglass and wood, ensures the game is strong and visually appealing.

2. Final Project Design stating how Multiple Arduinos will be used

Receiving the communication from the Transmitter(T1), receiver 1 (R1), receiver 2 (R2), and receiver 3 (R3) will delegate game component signals and instructions to the various game lights displays and switches to be interacted with by the players.

T1 will control the LCD screen and supply power to the other controllers. Additionally, transmits commands serially to the controllers and receives input from the game buttons and the on/off switch.

R1 will be responsible for the gameplay LED lights.

R2 will be responsible for the game's white lights and sound and will hold its corresponding playlist.

R3 will be responsible for the on/off LED light.

3. Final Plan for Use and Communication between the multiple Arduinos

This project utilizes four Arduino uno R3 cards in serial communication, one of which is the transmitter  (T1), and the other three are the receivers (R1), (R2), and (R3). The transmitter will be responsible for the game logic. Displaying the messages on the LCD screen and receiving signals from the play buttons. The (T1) will also transmit commands to the other three receivers, activating their components appropriately. (R1) will light the gameplay LEDs if 1, 3, 5, and 7 are received from the serial port. ( R2) will play buzzer sounds and white lights when 9 and B are received from the serial port. Finally, (R3) will illuminate the game on the LED when it gets an D or E from the serial port.

4. Final Project Design stating Expected Inputs/Outputs

Expected Inputs:

Game Start Button: This button is located inside the game and accessible by reaching through the side of the game.

Player Buttons: Each player will have a button to press in response to the white light and piezo sound. These buttons will be the primary input method for the players to register their reaction time.

Expected Outputs:

White Light and Piezo Sound: These signals will trigger the players to press buttons. The white light will be used as a visual cue, and the piezo sound will provide an auditory cue. These inputs will be directly integrated into the circuit.

Reaction Time Display: The fastest player’s reaction time will be displayed on the LCD screen. Additionally, the time differences between the other players will be displayed. This output will be facilitated through the microcontroller's programming.

Visual Indicators: LEDs will provide visual cues to the players. A pulsing yellow light will signal the start of the game, and another color (e.g., red) can indicate disqualification for premature button presses. The microcontroller will control these visual cues based on the game's logic.

5. Final Description of the original work being attempted by your project

The “Quickfire Game” was inspired by a simple yet engaging electronic game called the "Reaction Timer Game" [1]. In this original game, players press a button to start and watch an LED light change through random colors. The goal is to release the button when the LED turns red quickly. The time it takes for the player to react is shown in milliseconds on an LCD screen. There's also a buzzer that makes random sounds to make the game more challenging. If you let go of the button too early, you must start over.

The game uses an RGB LED, a special light that combines red, green, and blue to make different colors. The LED is on a small board with built-in resistors, making it easy to set up. To build the game, you assemble parts like the LCD screen, a button, the LED, and a buzzer on a breadboard and connect them to an Arduino controller. The game's software is designed so you can't predict when the LED will turn red. The original game is not just fun but also teaches you about electronics and programming. It's the foundation for the "Quickfire Game," which turns this concept into a multiplayer game for everyone to enjoy

6. Discussion on how to build your project (think Lab Reports) -

Gather the necessary components:

Arduino or similar microcontroller board

White light sensor module

Piezo buzzer module

Push buttons (for each player)

LEDs (yellow, red)

LCD display module

Resistors (for LEDs and buttons)

Jumper wires

Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)

Set up the development environment:

Install the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO on your computer.

Open the project in your chosen IDE.

Build the circuit:

Follow the provided schematic as a reference.

Start by placing the Arduino board on a breadboard.

Connect the LCD display to the Arduino using jumper wires and resistors as per the schematic.

Wire up the pushbuttons, arcade buttons, LEDs, piezo speaker, and potentiometer according to the schematic.

Test each component individually to ensure proper functionality.

Upload the code:

Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.

Open the project code in your IDE.

Compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.

Verify that the code is running correctly by observing the initial test routine that cycles through lighting all the LEDs, sounding the piezo, and displaying text on the LCD.

Integrate the circuit into the case:

Design and build a case to house your circuit and components.

Arrange the breadboards and components within the case based on your desired layout.

Ensure that the USB port of the Arduino is accessible for future code updates or power supply.

Test and refine:

Power on the game and test all functionalities thoroughly.

Play the game with multiple players to ensure proper operation and gameplay experience.

Make any necessary adjustments to the circuit or code based on testing results.

7. Discussion on how your project is to be used (think User Guide)

Powering On: Connect the Arduino to a power source (either a USB cable or a battery, if installed).

Player Arrangement: Up to four players can participate. Each player should stand or sit near their designated button.

Playing the Game:

Starting a Round: Press the 'Start' button to begin. A random delay will occur, during which a pulsing yellow light appears.

Go Signal: Watch for the white light and listen for the piezo sound. These signals indicate it's time to press your button.

React and Press: Players must quickly press their button in response to the go signal. The fastest reaction time will be captured.

Results: The LCD screen displays the winning player's reaction time and how much slower the other players were.

Disqualification: If players press their button too early (before the go signal), they are disqualified from that round, indicated by a different LED color (e.g., red).

Safety and Care:

Keep the game away from water and extreme temperatures.

Supervise young children to ensure they handle the electronic components properly.

Troubleshooting:

If the game isn't functioning correctly, check all connections and ensure the Arduino is properly powered.
